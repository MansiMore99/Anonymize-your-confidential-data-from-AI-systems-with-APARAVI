Ever worry your AI might spill the beans on someone‚Äôs secrets? Maybe a phone number, a health record, or a hush-hush business plan? Time to relax ‚Äî APARAVI is your digital sidekick! With this next-level pipeline, you‚Äôll automatically spot and shield sensitive info before your AI even gets a whiff. Let‚Äôs turn your data into a fortress ‚Äî no capes required.

Why Privacy? Because You‚Äôre the Boss üï∂Ô∏è

Be the VIP Bouncer: Your pipeline is the hottest club in town ‚Äî only the right data gets past the velvet rope.
No Legal Drama: GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA‚Ä¶ APARAVI helps you breeze through compliance like a pro.
Trust Points = Power: When people know you‚Äôre guarding their info, they‚Äôll trust you more. That‚Äôs how legends are made.
Example:

Before: "Call me at 610‚Äì456‚Äì7091"
After: "Call me at ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà"

This is a Classification and Anonymization pipeline that processes text for privacy and categorization before embedding.


How the APARAVI Pipeline Works (And Why It‚Äôs Awesome) ‚ú®

Data Source Node
This node pulls your source files (e.g., Google Drive, S3, local docs).

2. Data Parser Node

In this node, we extract the content from the files. In this scenario, we are extracting text.

How it works

Receives ‚ÄúData‚Äù from the Sample Data node.
Splits into multiple channels: Text, Table, Image, Audio, Video.
3. Text Classification Node

Analyzes and categorizes text into predefined classes or categories.

4. Text Anonymizer Node

The Text Anonymizer node identifies and masks personally identifiable information (PII) in text to ensure privacy and compliance.

How it works

Scans text for PII, including names, emails, phone numbers, addresses, and other sensitive information.
Replaces identified PII with generic tokens or masks.
Preserves the semantic structure of the text while removing sensitive data.
5. Preprocessor ‚Äî General Text

This node splits large text blocks into smaller "documents" ready for embedding. Here, we‚Äôll take the large text segments and split them up into documents that can be embedded.

How it works

Takes parser output, applies sanitization, chunking, and metadata tagging.
Emits a stream of document objects.
6. Embedding ‚Äî Transformer

The Embedding - Sentence Transformer node is responsible for converting text (such as document segments or user questions) into vector embeddings, which are essential for semantic search and retrieval in a RAG pipeline.

How it works

Document transformer: turns each text chunk into a vector.
Available Options:

Custom model: Use your own pre-trained or fine-tuned model.
miniAll: A general-purpose model, suitable for a variety of tasks.
miniLM: Optimized for general use, offering a good balance between performance and speed.
mpnet: Another high-quality model, often providing strong results on semantic similarity tasks.
7. Vector Store (Qdrant) Node

The Qdrant Vector Store node is critical in a RAG pipeline. It is responsible for storing and retrieving vector embeddings, enabling efficient semantic search and context retrieval for downstream language models.

How it works

Ingests document embeddings + metadata.
On query, it computes the similarity between the question vector and stored vectors.
Returns top-K relevant document segments.

Pro Tips for Data Legends

Pick the right model: Got medical docs? Use a medical model. Business files? Go business!
Automate everything: Let APARAVI do the heavy lifting while you chill.
Spot-check: Take a peek now and then to make sure everything‚Äôs locked down tight.
Wrap-Up: Your Data, Your Rules üåü

With APARAVI, you get a privacy-first pipeline that‚Äôs smart, secure, and super easy to use. No more leaks, no more stress ‚Äî just cool, trustworthy AI that lets you sleep easily.

Ready to be a data hero? Set up your pipeline and give your data the VIP treatment it deserves!
